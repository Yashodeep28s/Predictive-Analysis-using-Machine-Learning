Codtech Internship – Task 2: Predictive Analysis on Instacart Market Basket Dataset

This project is part of my Codtech internship and focuses on performing predictive analysis using the Instacart Market Basket Analysis dataset. The primary goal is to leverage Dask for handling large-scale data efficiently and apply Machine Learning techniques to predict user purchasing behavior.

The dataset contains detailed information on customer orders, products, departments, and aisles. It enables the identification of shopping patterns, customer preferences, and product demand trends.

The project begins with data loading and preprocessing using Dask, which is well-suited for parallel computing and big data handling. Missing values are addressed, and relevant features are engineered for improved predictive performance.

Next, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand the structure, relationships, and distributions within the data. Insights from EDA guide the selection of predictive modeling strategies.

The machine learning workflow includes:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets

Applying classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Optimizing models to improve prediction quality

The predictive analysis aims to determine the likelihood of a user reordering a product in their next purchase. This can help e-commerce businesses like Instacart improve personalized recommendations, inventory planning, and targeted marketing strategies.

In addition, the project sets up data for visualization in Power BI, allowing for interactive dashboards and KPI tracking. This helps stakeholders better understand customer behavior patterns and make data-driven decisions.

The entire process—from data preprocessing to modeling—is implemented in Google Colab for accessibility, scalability, and ease of sharing.

This repository serves as a practical application of big data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence integration, showcasing how technical skills can be used to generate actionable business insights.
